## Undergraduate Research

At [the Hüner lab][huner] (Fall 2019–present), I'm involved in an experiment conducted at the [Biotron Experimental Climate Change Research Centre][biotron] examining the effects of climate change on physiology of boreal trees. I'm currently (Fall 2020–present) working on an honours thesis on photosynthetic energy partitioning and photoprotection in five boreal tree species.

Thank you to [NSERC USRA][usra] (as well as [Canadian Forest Sector Workforce Diversity supplements][cfs-supp]) for funding my research in Summer 2020!
