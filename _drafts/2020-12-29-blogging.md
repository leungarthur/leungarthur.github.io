title: Hosting a personal/academic website for free
---

This is the first post on my personal blog, which I aim to use to fulfil several goals (inspired by a post on low-cost blogging by a prof at UAB, see [^1]):
1. Educate the (lay) audience: if I'm going to be reading and annotating scientific articles, I might as well also practice writing about them.
2. Write about an opinion
3. Offer advice to other people like myself: there were some things that weren't obvious to me due to circumstances (e.g., due to not having grown up in North America) that I had to figure out myself
4. Archive/remember things for the long-term

A website is useful for making information easily accessible. According to the TA in one of the courses I took, in a pinch, it was easier for them to Google <my name> + "uwo" than to find my email through the course website.

Hosting a website is easier and cheaper than you think. Many people use Wordpress[^2], which is free with the option to pay CAD$5 a month for premium features, e.g., a custom domain. But if you're willing to learn how to use Markdown[^3], in my opinion it is better to use GitHub Pages[^4] to host a Jekyll[^5] website. This blog post will briefly go over why it is better and how you can get get started with Jekyll and Github Pages. I'm not at all an expert in programming, so this is from the perspective of a biologist with a tiny bit of computer science knowledge.

GitHub Pages is better than many other website solutions because it uses git, which is version-control system[^6][^7]. It's kind of like cloud storage software like Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive, except it's better in several ways (albeit more complicated to use). Unlike cloud storage software, through GitHub  you can:
- Track the history of all changes made (and who made them): If you make a mistake, you can revert to any previous version.
- Collaborate with others: Your colleague can make a branch (e.g. to implement a new feature) and their work will never interfere with yours. Secondary branches can then be merged with the primary branch. (see [Fig. 1](#fig1))
