Hi, I'm Arthur 👋. 

I'm a 4th year undergraduate student working towards a Bachelor of Science (Honors) in [Biology][biodept] at [the University of Western Ontario][western] (Western University). I'm working on an honours thesis investigating the physiology of photosynthesis and photoprotection in boreal tree species. After graduating in Summer 2021, I plan on pursuing my interest in plant biology in grad school.

## About

In my spare time, I like cooking, listening to R&B/soul music (e.g. [PJ Morton's rendition of How Deep Is Your Love by the Bee Gees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv8yRzstTDE), and learning new songs to play on my Stratocaster-style guitar.
