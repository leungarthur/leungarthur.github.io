Hi, I'm Arthur. Welcome to my website! Born in Ottawa, Canada and raised in Hong Kong, I'm currently back in Canada and finishing up a BSc in [Biology][biodept] at [the University of Western Ontario][western] (Western University). After graduating in Summer 2021, I plan on pursuing my interest in plant biology in grad school.

In my spare time, I like cooking, listening to R&B and soul music, and learning new songs to play on my Stratocaster-style guitar.

## Research

For grad school, I'm looking to pursue topics pertaining to photosynthesis, global change biology and/or high throughput methods.

### Undergraduate Research

At [the Hüner lab][huner] (Fall 2019–present), I'm involved in an experiment conducted at the [Biotron Experimental Climate Change Research Centre][biotron] examining the effects of climate change on physiology of boreal trees. I'm currently (Fall 2020–present) doing a thesis project on photosynthetic energy partitioning and photoprotection in five boreal tree species.

Thank you to [NSERC USRA][usra] (as well as [Canadian Forest Sector Workforce Diversity supplements][cfs-supp]) for funding my research in Summer 2020!
