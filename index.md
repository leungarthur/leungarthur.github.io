Hi, I'm Arthur. Welcome to my website! Born in Ottawa, Canada and raised in Hong Kong, I'm currently back in Canada and finishing up a BSc in [Biology][biodept] at [the University of Western Ontario][western] (Western University). I'm working on an honours thesis investigating photosynthetic physiology in boreal tree species. After graduating in Summer 2021, I plan on pursuing my interest in plant biology in grad school.

In my spare time, I like cooking, listening to R&B and soul music, and learning new songs to play on my Stratocaster-style guitar.

## Research

For grad school, I'm looking to pursue topics pertaining to photosynthesis, global change biology and/or high throughput methods.

### Undergraduate Research

At [the Hüner lab][huner] (Fall 2019–present), I'm involved in an experiment conducted at the [Biotron Experimental Climate Change Research Centre][biotron] examining the effects of climate change on physiology of boreal trees. I'm currently (Fall 2020–present) working on an honours thesis on photosynthetic energy partitioning and photoprotection in five boreal tree species.

Thank you to [NSERC USRA][usra] (as well as [Canadian Forest Sector Workforce Diversity supplements][cfs-supp]) for funding my research in Summer 2020!
