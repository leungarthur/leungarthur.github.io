Hi, I'm Arthur Leung, a 4th year undergrad at the [Dept of Biology][biology] at [the University of Western Ontario][western] (Western University). I plan on pursuing plant biology in grad school!

## Research

For grad school, I'm looking to pursue topics pertaining to photosynthesis, global change biology and/or high throughput methods.

### Undergraduate Research

At [the Hüner lab][huner] (Fall 2019–present), I'm involved in an experiment conducted at the [Biotron Experimental Climate Change Research Centre][biotron] examining the effects of climate change on physiology of boreal trees. I'm currently (Fall 2020–present) doing a thesis project on photosynthetic energy partitioning and photoprotection in five boreal tree species.

<small>Thank you to [NSERC USRA][usra] (as well as the [Canadian Forest Sector Workforce Diversity supplements program][cfs-supp]) for funding my summer research in 2020!</small>
