Hi, I'm Arthur 👋. 

Born in Ottawa, Canada and raised in Hong Kong, I'm currently back in Canada and in the 4th year of the BSc Honors [Biology][biodept] program at [the University of Western Ontario][western] (Western University). I'm working on an honours thesis investigating the physiology of photosynthesis and photoprotection in boreal tree species. After graduating in Summer 2021, I plan on pursuing my interest in plant biology in grad school.
