Hi, I'm Arthur. Welcome to my website! Born in Ottawa, Canada and raised in Hong Kong, I'm currently back in Canada and finishing up a BSc in [Biology][biodept] at [the University of Western Ontario][western] (Western University). I'm working on an honours thesis investigating photosynthetic physiology in boreal tree species. After graduating in Summer 2021, I plan on pursuing my interest in plant biology in grad school.

In my spare time, I like cooking, listening to R&B and soul music, and learning new songs to play on my Stratocaster-style guitar.
