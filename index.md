## Research

For grad school, I'm looking to pursue topics pertaining to photosynthesis, global change biology and/or high throughput methods.

### Undergraduate Research

At [the Hüner lab][huner] (Fall 2019–present), I'm involved in an experiment conducted at the [Biotron Experimental Climate Change Research Centre][biotron] examining the effects of climate change on physiology of boreal trees.

- I received the [NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award][usra] (with [Canadian Forest Sector Workforce Diversity supplement][cfs-supp]) for Summer 2020!
- I'm currently (Fall 2020–present) doing a thesis project on energy partitioning and photoprotection in photosynthesis in five boreal tree species.
