title:  "Jekyll: An under-utilized website generator"
---

These days, having a website is free. Services like [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) and [Weebly](https://weebly.com) enable you to start a blog for no cost with many options for customization. But as someone who's been visiting these sites frequently because of grad school applications, these services are overkill and lead to slow loading times; it is the feature-richness of these services that makes them poor choices for academic sites.

I suggest using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) ([here's a guide for macOS users](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/)), which is an open-source static site generator. In conjunction with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which can host your website for free, it makes for a very easy way for someone to find your information. Anecdotally, the TA in a course I took found it convenient that they were able to find my email without going into the student records for the course.

A domain is pretty affordable on various "retailers" like [Google](https://domains.google/) and [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com/). My domain costs $17 CAD (~$13.3 USD) per year to maintain and is the only cost to my website.  

Interesting comment from u/zmjones from Reddit in response to another commenter that said to "let your work speak for itself":

By the way, this website was made using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. I'm not an expert by any means, but feel free to contact me if you need help with getting your website running! :)
